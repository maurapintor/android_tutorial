    "In this online challenge, we focus on detecting malware for the Android Operating System. \n",
    "On this task, machine learning usually performs well, learning common patterns from data and enabling the detection of potentially never-before-seen malware samples. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, it has been shown that those detectors (i) tend to exhibit a rapid performance decay over time due to the natural evolution of samples and (ii) can be bypassed by slightly manipulating malware samples in an adversarial manner. \n",
    "The practical impact of these two issues is that current learning-based malware detectors need constant updates and retraining on newly collected and labeled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we are going to explore two important aspects of this challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data loading and creation of a baseline DREBIN model. Time-aware dataset splitting and understanding the statistics of the dataset.\n",
    "2. Adversarial manipulations in the feature space. Determining how many features need to be changed to bypass the detector.\n"

The features to be injected are sampled from a validation set composed of legitimate samples (`goodware_features`), while the features to be removed are the ones of the sample under attack (`malware_features`).\n",
    "- Note that not all features can be removed. We only consider those manipulations that **can be applied to APKs without breaking or altering their functionality**. In this way, we try to simulate a realistic attacker that is able to directly manipulate the APK file. While it is safe to inject features (e.g., by adding code slices that are never invoked), removing them (e.g., with obfuscation or encryption techniques) is not always possible. For this reason, the attack cannot remove features from $S_1$, $S_2$, $S_4$, and $S_6$ subsets.\n",
    "- The attack has no knowledge about the classifier architecture and parameters and can access its output score only. However, we assume the attacker is aware of and can directly manipulate the feature representation used by the detector. In a real-world scenario, this still represents a strong attacker as usually the feature extraction process is obscure and the attacker does not know which features are actually extracted and fed into the classifier.\n",
